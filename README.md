# Text-to-Notes
Converts audio to notes


This program converts large pieces of text to notes.
I am using it to convert voice notes on my phone to notes for class.
To transcribe the audio I am using [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper), Which I find works really well for being free.

## How To Use The Program
To use this all you have to do is drag your text into the audio.txt file then run the main.py. Your output will be in the terminal and under a newly created notes.md
  - make sure to download the required packages
  - ```install -r requirements.txt```
  - make sure you enter your own openai api token into the code at the top
    - to get your token go to [openai](openai.com), make a account and copy your Secret key

## Final Notes
I have left A script to the [Wendover Productions](https://youtu.be/1-m_Jjse-cs) video as a example in the audio.txt, so delete that if you don't try it out first.

Enjoy the program and feel free to reachout to me on discord if you have suggestions
